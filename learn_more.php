								<p class="sub_main_title">That's the power of Town Center</p>
								<p class="sub_txt">Every day, there are roughly 543 million internet searches. Approximately 20% of those searches are made for local companies. What if a customer is searching for a company like yours, but you aren't listed? Here at Town Center, we solve that problem for you.  We offer you a simple yet reliable way to get seen across the internet.</p>

								<div class="learn_more_power"></div>
								<p class="sub_main_title">We give you more for less.</p>
								<p class="sub_txt">We have the most coverage. And we are still going. Town Center covers a spectrum that spreads over more than 50 different websites. Our competitors only spread over 40. By putting you on more websites, you guarantee that you will get noticed faster and more often. We are also adding more and more websites every week to our coverage list. We are expanding to provide you the most coverage for your business. </p>
								<img src="images/spacer.png" alt="" width="923" height="43" class="sub_spacer"/>
								<div class="learn_more_share"></div>
								<p class="sub_main_title">Facebook?  Google+? Twitter? Bing? We got&acute;'em. They don&acute;t.</p>
								<p class="sub_txt">True, our compepitors can list your business on Yahoo!, Yelp, and LinkedIn. But can they list you on Facebook, Twitter, Google, or Bing? Nope. We can. We cover the top-grossing internet companies and search engines, meaning that even more people will be able to find your company. We get you into the places that they cant.</p>
								<img src="images/spacer.png" alt="" width="923" height="43" class="sub_spacer"/>
								<div class="learn_more_budget"></div>
								<p class="sub_main_title">Affordable? You Bet.</p>
								<p class="sub_txt">The enrollement fee is only $299, and then it's only $29 a month. As we put you on more websites, you don't pay a thing - that's right, our rate stays the same. Which means that as we get you on more websites, you get noticed more, which means you get more money. Who doesn't like that?</p>
								<img src="images/spacer.png" alt="" width="923" height="43" class="sub_spacer"/>
								<div class="learn_more_keep">
									<p class="learn_more_keep_title">Change, update, post and upload made easy.</p>
									<img src="images/learn_more_keep.png" width="286" height="164" alt=""/>
								</div>
								<p class="sub_main_title mtm_35">We keep it Simple.</p>
								<p class="sub_txt">Town Center allows you to make changes by the Town Center Client download. This allows you to change your business information, post new deals and specials, even upload pictures on one page, and Town Center will upload all the new information across our spectrum. We do all the work, you get all the benefits. </p>
