								<p class="sub_main_title">Visibility Optimization is Essential for Businesses of All Sizes</p>
								<p class="sub_txt">You might be a one person, part-time business just getting started, or an established organization with dozens, hundreds or even thousands of employees. You might be growing fast, opening new locations each week, or simply holding your own in this rapidly changing new economy. You may have invested untold fortunes in cultivating your online presence, or you might not even have a website yet. No matter. Regardless of the your business size, type, or rate of growth - the benefits are clear. Greater online visibility translates to more clients, more sales, and higher profits. Even charitable and political organizations need to be easily locatable, in order to keep those donations and volunteers rolling in. Whatever sort of business you're doing, TownCenter will help you to do more of it.</p>

								<p class="sub_main_title">Nobody Beats TownCenter.</p>
								<p class="sub_txt">Our network of sites is the largest, and we're committed to retaining that distinction. With over 50 databases, search engines and indexes, we're substantially more comprehensive than our competition. And at just $39 per month, we're less expensive, too. While our coverage will continue to expand, month after month - our prices won't. </p>

								<p class="sub_main_title">The Best Advertising  Decisions Quickly Pay for Themselves. </p>
								<p class="sub_txt">Do the math - How much extra business would it take in order for your company to make one extra dollar a day? if you make $30 per sale, the answer is: Just one additional client per month. Regardless of the size of your company, or the nature of your business, maximizing your online visibility at the low cost of about one dollar per day is sure to quickly pay for itself several times over. Let's say, for example, you make $50 per sale, and you close two extra sales per week as a result of your increased visibility... that's an extra $5,200 dollars per year - even after subtracting the cost of the first year of membership - $5,200 minus $299 (cost for the first year) = $4,901 in additional profit. Your mileage, of course, may vary - If you're selling luxury cars, and you close a couple of extra deals per week... Like we said, do the math! </p>

								<p class="sub_main_title mtm_35">Automation Saves Time and Energy.</p>
								<p class="sub_txt">Manually updating your company's listings in dozens of online databases is incredibly time consuming. By automating this process, we give you back that valuable time and energy you would have spent on busy work, allowing you to focus on what you know best - your organization, and the products and services you provide. There are just so many hours in a day - in order to make them count, efficiency via automation is essential. Rather than asking if you can afford our service, ask instead if you can afford to be without the very best indexing automation software and support at your fingertips. </p>
