00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:03,000
There are customers out there who can’t find your business online.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:09,080
Some directories have you listed, but others don’t. Or, they don’t have the right information.

3
00:00:9,350 --> 00:00:13,350
Unfortunately, when you’re running a business, this is not your highest priority.

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,000
It’s not like it’s a giant billboard in a prime time location.

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:22,000
BUT with tons of directories online, having a listing on all of these sites, is like having billboards all over the city.

6
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:27,000
Trouble is, you’re probably too busy, and hiring a marketing consultant costs big bucks.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That’s where Town Center comes in; a one-stop solution for managing all of your online business profiles on all the big sites (Google+ Local, Facebook, Twitter, Yelp, Foursquare) and tons more.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
All you have to do is install Town Center on your computer. Create your profile.  And then… walah… every single directory is updated automatically.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And whenever want to make a change, upload a picture, or even share a special offer, you just update your profile, click Sync Now, and the change is made everywhere.

00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
